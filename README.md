<H2> Azure Network Protocols </H2>
<p>This lab demonstrates how to create and configure virtual machines (VMs) in Azure, observe network traffic, and manage security settings. It covers setting up a Windows 10 and Ubuntu VM, using Wireshark to capture and analyze ICMP, SSH, DHCP, DNS, and RDP traffic, and configuring a Network Security Group (NSG) to control inbound traffic. The lab also includes tasks like pinging, SSHing, and observing real-time traffic in Wireshark, while learning about network protocols and security configurations./p>

<h2> Requirements </h2>
<p> 
  
 -   Azure Account (free tier works)

 -  Microsoft Remote Desktop (for macOS users)

 -  Wireshark is installed on a Windows 10 VM

 -  Windows 10 VM and Linux VM in Azure

 -  Resource Group and Virtual Network in Azure

 -  Network Security Group (NSG) for traffic management

 -  Basic knowledge of network protocols (ICMP, SSH, DHCP, DNS, RDP)</p>

<h2> Step 1: Create VMs on Azure </h2>
<p> To start, log in to the Azure Portal at https://portal.azure.com/. Next, create a Resource Group by navigating to Resource Groups > Create, then name the resource group and choose the region. Afterward, click Review + Create, then click Create.

For the Windows 10 VM, go to Virtual Machines > Create > Virtual Machine. Select the previously created Resource Group and choose Windows 10 as the image. For authentication, select Username/Password and allow Azure to create a new Virtual Network (VNet) and Subnet. Click Review + Create, then Create.

To create the Linux (Ubuntu) VM, navigate to Virtual Machines > Create > Virtual Machine. Select the same Resource Group and Virtual Network as the Windows 10 VM, ensuring both VMs are in the same VNet/Subnet. For authentication, use Username/Password, then click Review + Create, and Create.

<h2> Part 2: Observe ICMP Traffic</h2>
<P>Part 2: Observe ICMP Traffic
Connect to Windows 10 VM

1. Connect to Windows 10VM
   - Use Microsoft Desktop (if on Mac) to connect to oyur Windows 10 Vm

2. Install Wireshark

  - Inside the Windows 10 VM, download and install Wireshark.

3. Start Packet Capture

  - Launch Wireshark and click Start Capture on the main interface.
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/4SfG2pd.jpeg" height="80%" width="80%">
    
  -  Set the display filter to "icmp" to isolate ping traffic.

4. Ping Ubuntu VM (Private IP)
 - In the Azure Portal, get the private IP address of your Ubuntu VM.
   <img src="https://i.imgur.com/vCwB6B8.jpeg" height= "80%" width="80%" >   
 - Watch for ICMP request and reply traffic in Wireshark
</P>
<h2> Part3:Configure Firewall Rules (NSG) & Observe SSH Traffic</h2>
<p>Section 1: Configuring a Firewall (Network Security Group)
1. On your Windows 10 VM, start a continuous ping to the private IP address of your Ubuntu VM using Command Prompt or PowerShell.

2. Go to the Network Security Group (NSG) associated with your Ubuntu VM in the Azure Portal.
<img src= "https://i.imgur.com/x78mcOA.jpeg" height="80%" width="80%"> 
3. Edit the Inbound Rules to block ICMP traffic by disabling the rule that allows it.

4. Return to the Windows 10 VM and observe:

  - In Wireshark, ICMP reply packets should stop appearing.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/EuMLny0.jpeg" height="80%" width="80%" > 
  - In Command Prompt, the ping should start failing or timing out.
<img src= "https://i.imgur.com/wCZ5IKs.jpeg" height="80%" width="80%">
5. Return to the NSG settings and re-enable ICMP traffic by restoring the inbound rule.

6. Back in the Windows 10 VM, confirm that the ping is working again and ICMP packets are visible in Wireshark.

7. Stop the ping activity once confirmed.

</p>

<h2> Observe SSH Traffic</h2>
<p> 
1. Reconnect to your Windows 10 VM using Remote Desktop.

2. Open Wireshark and start a new packet capture session.

3. Apply a filter to display only SSH traffic.

4. From the Windows 10 VM, initiate an SSH connection to the Ubuntu VM using its private IP address.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/oHwN14E.jpeg" height="80%" width="80%">  
5. Log in by entering the Ubuntu VMâ€™s username and password when prompted.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/94qJl9U.jpeg" height="80%" width="80%" >
6. Type a few commands within the SSH session to generate traffic.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/kBrnnP3.jpeg" height="80%" width="80%" >
7. In Wireshark, observe the flow of encrypted SSH packets between the two VMs.

8. Exit the SSH session once complete.

</p>

<h2>  Observe DHCP Traffic </h2>
<p>
1. In Wireshark, apply a filter to display only DHCP traffic.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/TSdsllH.jpeg" height="80%" width="80%">
2. On the Windows 10 VM, attempt to renew the IP address by issuing a command that triggers DHCP.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/TSdsllH.jpeg" height="80%" width="80%">
3. Monitor Wireshark as it displays DHCP request and response packets, showing the lease renewal process in action.</p>

<h2>Observe DNS Traffic</h2>
<p>
1. In Wireshark, apply a filter to show only DNS traffic.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/nZuUpS5.jpeg" height="80%" width="80%">
  2. On the Windows 10 VM, use a command to look up domain names like google.com and disney.com.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/KapVTIi.jpeg" height="80%" width="80%">
  3. Watch Wireshark display DNS query and response packets as the domain names are resolved into IP addresses.</p>
<img src= "https://i.imgur.com/UpFzG5n.jpeg" height="80%" width80%">

<h2>   Observe RDP Traffic </h2>
<p>
1. In Wireshark, set a filter to display RDP traffic only.

2. Notice the continuous stream of packets even when you're not actively clicking or typing.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/tpmM23O.jpeg" height="80%" width="80%"> 
3. This constant activity happens because the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) maintains a live session view between your local machine and the VM, which requires ongoing traffic transmission</p>

<h2> Congratulations!</h2>
<P> You've successfully completed the Azure Networking & Protocol Analysis Lab! 

In this hands-on project, you:

 - Deployed and configured virtual machines in Azure

 - Explored how ICMP, SSH, DHCP, DNS, and RDP traffic flows through a network

 - Captured and analyzed live network packets using Wireshark

 - Modified Network Security Group (NSG) rules to control traffic flow

These skills are foundational for roles in IT support, cloud operations, and cybersecurity. </P>
